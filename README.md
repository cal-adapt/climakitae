**A powerful Python toolkit for climate data analysis and retrieval from the Cal-Adapt Analytics Engine (AE).**

Climakitae provides intuitive tools for accessing, analyzing, and visualizing downscaled CMIP6 data, enabling researchers and practitioners to perform comprehensive climate impact assessments for California.

> [!WARNING]
> This package is under active development. APIs may change between versions.

## Key Features

- 🌡️ **Comprehensive Climate Data Access**: Retrieve climate variables from hosted climate models
- 📊 **Downscaled Climate Models**: Access dynamical (WRF) and statistical (LOCA2) downscaling methods  
- 🗺️ **Spatial Analysis Tools**: Built-in support for geographic subsetting and spatial aggregation
- 📈 **Climate Indices**: Calculate heat indices, warming levels, and extreme event metrics
- 🔧 **Flexible Data Export**: Export to NetCDF, CSV, and Zarr
- 📱 **GUI Integration**: Works seamlessly with [climakitaegui](https://github.com/cal-adapt/climakitaegui) for interactive analysis

## About Cal-Adapt

Climakitae is developed as part of the [Cal-Adapt Analytics Engine](https://analytics.cal-adapt.org), a platform for California climate data and tools. Cal-Adapt provides access to cutting-edge climate science to support adaptation planning and decision-making.
