WIND_MAG,Wind Magnitude at 10m,Wind speed at 10 meters above the Earth's surface. Computed by taking the vector magnitude of the west-east (u) component of wind and the north-south (v) component of wind.,m/s,knots

SWUPBC,Instantaneous upwelling clear sky shortwave flux at bottom,Shortwave radiation from the sun that is reflected by Earth's surface back to space.,W/m2,
SNOWNC,Snowfall (snow and ice),Portion of the total precipitation in the form of snow and ice.,mm,inches
RAINC,Precipitation (cumulus portion only),"Any form of precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) that is produced specifically by cumulus/cumulonimbus clouds. These are generally small clouds that bring heavy precipitation.",mm,inches
RAINNC,Precipitation (grid-scale portion only),"Any form of precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) captured by the model resolution (i.e. 45km). Small clouds (including cumulus clouds) typically are excluded from this.",mm,inches
